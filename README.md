`cloudretic/matcha` is an actively developed HTTP router for Go with a focus on providing a flexible and performant route API.

## Features

- Static string routes, wildcard parameters, regex validation, and prefix routes
- Highly customizable route/router construction; get the results you want with the syntax that feels best to you
- Comprehensive and passing test coverage, and extensive benchmarks to track performance
- Native middleware to help you add common functionality, extensible when native support doesn't fit your use case
- No dependencies, what you see is what you get

For a preview of what's upcoming, see our [roadmap](docs/roadmap.md).

## Installation

`go get github.com/cloudretic/matcha@v1.1.2`

## Basic Usage

Here's a "Hello, World" example to introduce you to Matcha's syntax! It serves requests to `http://localhost:8080/hello`

```go
package examples

import (
    "net/http"

    "github.com/cloudretic/matcha/pkg/router"
)

func sayHello(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
    w.Write([]byte("Hello, World!"))
}

func HelloExample() {
    rt := router.Default()
    rt.HandleFunc(http.MethodGet, "/hello", sayHello)
    // or:
    // rt.Handle(http.MethodGet, "/hello", http.HandlerFunc(sayHello))
    http.ListenAndServe(":3000", rt)
}
```

## Benchmarks

> These benchmarks are run on the GitHub API provided by [julienschmidt](https://github.com/julienschmidt/go-http-routing-benchmark), updated to match the current Go version.

Short answer: in tests with handling of *single requests* to a large API (~200 routes), Matcha can handle requests end-to-end in about 470 nanoseconds, using about 720 bytes of memory, when running on an M2 MacBook Pro.

Long answer: Go benchmarks provide a measurement of `ns/op` and `B/op`, representing how much time and memory was used for one "operation", which in this case is one full loop of handling *every route* in the API, a common metric used to compare http routers in Go. Since speed in nanoseconds can be machine-dependent, we have provided a relative value instead for this comparison, where the value is (Matcha result)/(`other` result). Higher is better/faster.

Router Name | Relative Speed | Memory Use
--- | --- | ---
`cloudretic/matcha` | 1.0x | 44,785 B/op
[`go-chi/chi`](https://github.com/go-chi/chi) | 1.26x | 61,713 B/op
[`julienschmidt/httprouter`](https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter) | 4.96x | 13,792 B/op
[`gin-gonic/gin`](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) | 4.96x | 0 B/op
